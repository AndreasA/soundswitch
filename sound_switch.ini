[Sound Devices]
;The Sound Devices section should contain the names of two devices you want to
;switch between with the "SwitchDefault", "SwitchDevice", or "SwitchComm" hotkeys
;specified in the [HotKeys] section.

;Each Source should contain text from the source you want to switch between.
;This text should be a substring of the string created by adding the first two
;lines of text for the device in the Sound applet.

;For example the Logitech G35 Headset looks something like this in the Sound 
;applet:

;Speakers
;Logitech G35 Headset
;Default Device

;The text you provide will be matched against "Speakers Logitech G35 Headset".
;This line matches this device (if it's unique):
Source1=Speakers High Definition Audio Device

;You only have to provide enough text to be unique.
Source2=Speakers 4- Logitech G35 Headset
